# 🐍 Retro Snake Game (PF Project)

A **console-based, multiplayer Snake game** built in C++ during my **Programming Fundamentals** course. Inspired by the classic Nokia Snake, this version offers **multiple gameplay modes**, **unlimited players**, and **score tracking** — all in a nostalgic retro style.

## 🧩 Game Modes (Levels)

Choose from multiple level types — each with unique mechanics:

1. 🔁 **Wrap-Around Mode**  
   Going off one edge brings your snake back from the opposite side.

2. 🧱 **Bounded Box Mode**  
   The edges are solid — hitting the boundary ends your game.

3. 🚧 **Wall Mode**  
   Walls are placed inside the map — avoid crashing into them.

4. ⏱️ **Timed Food Mode**  
   Food appears for a limited time — miss it, and it's gone!
